I'm a 26 year old software engineer in Hong Kong who loves to build and write. I'm currently working at a HFT firm building trading systems in Rust and C#. Graduated with a degree in Computer Science from The University of Hong Kong in 2020. 

Co-founder of **[Brushless](https://brushless.ai)**, an AI design-app to build fully-editable and consistent vector illustrations in your brand-style and colors. I work on it in my free time, growing it into a complete brand-design-app.

***Excited about Building startups, Being curious, AI, Core CS, Crypto Markets, Gyming, Poker and Squash, in that order. Hit me up if we share common interests***.
